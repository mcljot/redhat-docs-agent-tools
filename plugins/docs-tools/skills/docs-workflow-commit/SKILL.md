# Commit Step

Step skill for the docs-orchestrator pipeline. Commits documentation files listed in the writing manifest and pushes the feature branch to the remote.

**Skipped when `--draft` is set** (no repo modifications in draft mode).

## Arguments

- `$1` — JIRA ticket ID (required)
- `--base-path <path>` — Base output path (e.g., `.claude/docs/proj-123`)
- `--repo-path <path>` — Target repository path. If omitted, uses the current working directory
- `--draft` — If present, skip committing entirely

## Input

```text
<base-path>/writing/step-result.json
```

The writing step's sidecar, containing the `files` array of absolute paths.

## Output

```text
<base-path>/commit/commit-info.json
<base-path>/commit/step-result.json
```

`commit-info.json` contains branch name, commit SHA, files committed, platform, repo URL, and push status. `step-result.json` is the standard sidecar with commit metadata.

## Execution

Run the commit script, passing through all arguments:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/commit.py <ticket> --base-path <base-path> [--repo-path <path>] [--draft]
```

The script handles:

1. **Draft mode check** — writes a skip record and exits if `--draft` is set
2. **Context resolution** — determines repo path, branch, platform, and remote URL from `--repo-path` argument or current working directory git context
3. **Safety checks** — refuses to push to `main`/`master`
4. **Manifest reading** — extracts file paths from `<base-path>/writing/step-result.json`
5. **Commit** — stages manifest-listed files and commits with a descriptive message
6. **Push** — pushes the feature branch to origin (uses `--force-with-lease` for pipeline-generated branches)
7. **Output** — writes `commit-info.json` with commit metadata and `step-result.json` sidecar
